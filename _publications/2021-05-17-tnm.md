abstract: "<p><b>Abstract</b>. Networks of collaboration between engineers are reflected in traces of developers' activity in version control systems (VCSs). Extracting data from Git repositories is an essential task for researchers and practitioners working on socio-technical analysis, but it requires substantial engineering work. With increasing interest in analysing socio-technical data and applying it in practice, there are no flexible and easily reusable tools to retrieve socio-technical information from VCSs. With no common reusable toolkit existing for this task, the burden of mining diverts the focus of researchers from their core research questions. In this paper, we present TNM -- an open-source tool for mining socio-technical data from Git repositories. TNM is fast, flexible, and easily extensible.</p>"
