My name is Mikhail (Misha) Evtikhiev, I am a researcher in the
[Machine Learning Methods in Software Engineering](https://lp.jetbrains.com/research/ml_methods/) and [Intelligent Collaboration Tools Lab](https://lp.jetbrains.com/research/ictl/) groups at
[JetBrains Research](https://www.jetbrains.com/research/).

<h2 style="margin-top: -5px;">Background</h2>

In 2013, I got a Bachelor's degree with honors in Physics from [St Petersburg Polytechnical University](https://english.spbstu.ru/university/), majoring in Astrophysics.
I did my graduate studies at [Weizmann Institute of Science](https://weizmann.ac.il), majoring in Theoretical Physics. I got my MSc in 2015 and defended my PhD in 2020.
My PhD thesis subject was "[On Superconformal Field Theories and Little String Theories](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=NuYsOk4AAAAJ&citation_for_view=NuYsOk4AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC)".

<h2 style="margin-top: -5px;">Research</h2>

I work on two different topics, and pursue each of them in a corresponding JetBrains Research group.
First, I am interested in improving performance of deep learning models for code. I work on that at Machine Learning Methods in Software Engineering group,
and currently I am focused on using various mathematical methods to improve code generation quality.
Second, I study how engineers work in a team, and how can we help them to manage teamwork-related problems. At Intelligent Collaboration Tools Lab,
I use exploratory interviews and surveys to understand the pain points better, and devise approaches to create tools that will address these pain points.
