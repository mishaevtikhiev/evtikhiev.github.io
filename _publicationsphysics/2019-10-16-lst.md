abstract: '<p><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper, we study the 6d Little String Theory (LST) (the decoupled
theory on the worldvolume of N NS5-branes) on curved manifolds, by using its holographic
duality to Type II string theory in asymptotically linear dilaton backgrounds. We focus
on backgrounds with a large number of Killing vectors (namely, products of maximally
symmetric spaces), without requiring supersymmetry (we do not turn on any background
fields except the metric). LST is non-local so it is not obvious which spaces it can be
defined on; we show that holography implies that the theory cannot be put on negatively
curved spaces, but only on spaces with zero or positive curvature. For example, one cannot
put LST on a product of an anti-de Sitter space times another space, without turning on
extra background fields. On spaces with positive curvature, such as S6, R2 × S4, S3 × S3,
etc., we typically find (for large N) dual holographic backgrounds which are weakly coupled
and weakly curved everywhere, so that they can be well-described by Type II supergravity.
In some cases more than one smooth solution exists for LST on the same space, and they
all contribute to the partition function. We also study the thermodynamical properties
of LST compactified on spheres, finding the leading correction to the Hagedorn behavior
of the spectrum, which is different on curved space than on flat space. We discuss the
holographic renormalization procedure, which must be implemented in order to get a finite
free energy for the LST; we do not know how to implement it for general spaces, but we
can (and we do) implement it for the theory compactified on S4.</p>'
