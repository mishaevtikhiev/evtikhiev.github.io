abstract: '<p><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper we discuss various N = 3 SCFTs in 4 dimensions and in particular
those which can be obtained as a discrete gauging of an N = 4 SYM theories with non-
simply laced groups. The main goal of the project was to compute the Coulomb branch
superconformal index and moduli space Hilbert series for the N = 3 SCFTs that are
obtained from gauging a discrete subgroup of the global symmetry group of N = 4 Super
Yang-Mills theory. The discrete subgroup contains elements of both SU(4) R-symmetry
group and the S-duality group of N = 4 SYM. This computation was done for the simply
laced groups (where the S-duality groups is SL(2, Z) and Langlands dual of the algebra Lg
is simply g) by Bourton et al., and we extended it to the non-simply laced groups. We
also considered the orbifolding groups of the Coulomb branch for the cases when Coulomb
branch is relatively simple; in particular, we compared them with the results of Argyres
et al., who classified all N ≥ 3 moduli space orbifold geometries at rank 2 and with
the results of Bonetti et al., who listed all possible orbifolding groups for the freely
generated Coulomb branches of N ≥ 3 SCFTs. Finally, we have considered sporadic
complex crystallographic reflection groups with rank greater than 2 and analyzed, which
of them can correspond to an N = 3 SCFT with a principal Dirac pairing.</p>'
