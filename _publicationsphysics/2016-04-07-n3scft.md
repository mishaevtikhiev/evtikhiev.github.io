abstract: '<p><b>Abstract</b>: In this note we study four dimensional theories with N = 3 superconformal
symmetry, that do not also have N = 4 supersymmetry. No examples of such theories are
known, but their existence is also not ruled out. We analyze several properties that such
theories must have. We show that their conformal anomalies obey a = c. Using the N = 3
superconformal algebra, we show that they do not have any exactly marginal deformations
preserving N = 3 supersymmetry, or global symmetries (except for their R-symmetries).
Finally, we analyze the possible dimensions of chiral operators labeling their moduli space.</p>'
